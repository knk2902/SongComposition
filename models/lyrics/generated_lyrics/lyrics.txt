It is a beautiful day
And I want to be without you
I was on the battle of blooded shadows falling in the club the throw to you
You were strating in the state
It's all about to give a damn with a baby your money
You're in the sun, the moon I had the harder than many things that I say no more 
I know I'm not alone

I'm gonna get my whole lot of place
I love the things that makes me wanna get me home

I wanna live in love

I hope you love me, my face
I know you say you were near

I don't wanna see the truth baby, you b
